# The FIzz BUzz Challenge :

**Code is present in above python file**

## Brief History - 

Fizz Buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, 
replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz" and 
any number divisible by both three and five is replaced with the word "fizzbuzz"

## For example, 
a typical round of fizz buzz would start as follows: 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz, 
16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, Fizz Buzz, 31, 32, Fizz, 34, Buzz, Fizz, …

## Question-
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to n and for multiples of '3' print "Fizz" instead of the number,
for the multiples of '5' print "Buzz", and for the numbers which are divisible by both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz.
